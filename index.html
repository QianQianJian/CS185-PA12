                Hello! My name is Zora. I was born in Anhui, China. And at the age of 16, I went abroad for study. 
                In 2018, I was accepted in UCSB and became a college student. Because of COVID-19, I stay in Suzhou and take
                my online classes. This is the webpage I made for CS 185. It shows who I am and what I am interested in. 
                Image and Video tabs display some of the happy moments in my life. Table tab shows what projects I have done.
                Hope you will enjoy it!
